## About Me

I am a final-year master's student at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm), under the mentorship of Prof. [Gang Pan](https://gpantju.github.io/index/). Previously, I worked as a research intern at [Baidu](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/en) and explored [multimodal document understanding](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR). 

My enthusiasm broadly lies in exploring Multimodal Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision, with the goal of enhancing the ability of intelligent models to understand and generate complex data in open-world scenarios. My recent series of multimodal research ([MNER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12212)->[GMNER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09989)->[SMNER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07268)->[VP-MEL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06720)) explored how to unleash the potential capabilities of visual-language models in complex multimodal scenarios, how to build harmonious interaction and collaboration between multiple models, and how to construct image-text based knowledge augmentation methods in open-world scenarios. Additionally, I also maintain interest in several visual tasks (e.g., [Blind Image Inpainting](https://jinyuanli0012.github.io/assets/files/TMM_AFAN.pdf), [Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://github.com/NaNagi2020/DSTFuse)). 

I am more concerned about the problems that are worth solving rather than limiting myself to a specific field. Feel free to contact me and explore possibilities together.

## Miscellaneous
When Iâ€™m not in research mode, I enjoy swimming (Swim one kilometer freestyle in less than 18 minutes) and violin (Fluent sight-reading skills). They have been with me for nearly twenty years. My favorite virtuoso is Ray Chen. His interpretation of the music always carries a distinct personal touch. I hope I can approach my research in the same way.

In the past, I demonstrated good road cycling ability (being able to maintain a speed of 36 km/h for two hours), but I no longer continue this sport.
